# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
#
# Builds ums-public-web's SSR bundle. Two-stage build, mirroring ums-core's own Dockerfile
# rationale: the `build` stage needs the full Node/npm toolchain plus devDependencies (the
# Angular CLI/compiler) to run `ng build`; the `runtime` stage copies only the compiled
# `dist/public-web/{browser,server}` output into a slim Node image, so the final image ships
# neither devDependencies nor the Angular build tooling.
#
# API_BASE_URL (build arg): Angular inlines `environment.ts` into the compiled bundle at build
# time - it is not a runtime-configurable value - so this app's API base URL has to be baked in
# here rather than passed as a container env var. Defaults to the browser-reachable
# host-published ums-core port (matches ums-devops's own UMS_CORE_PORT default) because every API
# call this app's own browser bundle makes originates client-side (see this repo's own
# src/app/core/http/provide-core-http.ts). See ums-devops's docker-compose.yml "Frontend API base
# URL" comment for the full reasoning and its one known limitation: this app renders almost every
# route with RenderMode.Server (its own app.routes.server.ts), so its own Node process's
# server-side data-fetch calls (and the /sitemap.xml route) also use this same URL, which is only
# reachable from the host, not from inside this container's own network namespace.

# package*.json + vendor/ first (not the whole source tree) so `npm ci` gets its own cached layer
# - vendor/*.tgz has to come along because package.json pins @ums/design-system and @ums/shared
# as `file:vendor/...tgz` dependencies (this repo's own README "Local package consumption").
